      This Administrative Guideline defines the numbering format for
      SMPTE Engineering Documents and specifies the permitted file
      formats used during document development and publication. It
      also specifies other matters relating to SMPTE Engineering
      Documents with regard to language, style, format, document
      type, markups required at various stages of development, etc.
    </p>
    <p>
      Files that show the differences between two versions of the
      same document are called "markups" in this Administrative
      Guideline. "Markup" is intended to cover a variety of terms
      including: "redline," "tracked changes," "blackline," etc.

      <h3>SMPTE Templates</h3>
      <p>
        All new Engineering Documents shall use the appropriate, approved SMPTE template. (See Administrative Guideline <a href="https://www.smpte.org/2020-standard-policies-and-governance">AG-04</a> Engineering Document Templates.) This will ensure proper     revision management through and including final publication. Document templates can be found in the Standards Community document repository.

    <section id="sec-revisions-and-amendments">
      <h3>Revisions and Amendments</h3>
      <p>
        A revision of an Engineering Document may use the original template if the resulting prose is identical to that resulting from use of the current template and the Standards Vice President or Director of Engineering agree to the use of the original publication template.
      </p>
      <p>
        For a revision of an Engineering Document, the Project Group should start with the Publication Master, which usually can be obtained from SMPTE HQ. The Project Group may, at its discretion, recreate the original document, as published, if an editable master cannot be found. The Project Group is encouraged to follow the ISO Directives but is under no obligation to do so.

    <section id="sec-publication-formats-overview">
      <h3>Publication Formats Overview</h3>
      <p>
        SMPTE Engineering Documents may be published on paper or in various electronic formats and may comprise one or more separate elements. An Engineering Document always shall include a single prose element and may include other elements such as XML, spreadsheets, media files, and so forth. The collection of elements, regardless of formats employed, is the "Engineering Document" as a whole, and all elements shall be clearly identified in the prose element (see <a href="#sec-elements"></a>). Any change to any element constitutes a change to the Engineering Document. The Project Group and the Technology Committee shall determine the number of elements for publication. The Director of Engineering shall determine the distribution media for all published documents. The format of publication shall alter neither the relevance of, nor the processes that otherwise are required for approval of, an Engineering Document.
      </p>
      <p>
        Engineering Document Elements may be packaged as one or more Elements using ZIP to facilitate the organization and distribution of the component files.

    <h2>Normative Language Forms</h2>
    <p>
      Normative information in a SMPTE Engineering Document may take the language form of prose, tables, figures, formal languages (e.g., mathematical formulae, BNF, XML, pseudo code), and other language forms. Mathematical formulae shall follow the definitions documented in ISO 80000-2 when possible. When ISO 80000-2 is not sufficient (e.g., BNF, XML Schema, etc.), a Normative Reference for the mathematical definitions used shall be provided. Such Normative Reference shall comply with the provisions of the <a href="#bib-smpte-standards-operations-manual"></a> and AG-03 Normative References.
    </p>
    <p>
      When language forms other than prose are present, the prose shall state whether the language is normative or informative. Normative provisions shall be enabled explicitly (e.g., "The dimensions of figure 1 shall be used."). The presence of non-prose information without prose conformance language shall be deemed informative.

    <h2>Document Numbering</h2>

    <section id="sec-document-numbering-overview">
      <h3>Document Numbering Overview</h3>
      <p>
        Document numbers shall be unique and uniform across all Engineering Document types. Versions of documents shall be identified by their year of publication and, optionally, their month of publication, appended with a separating colon (e.g., for document #1020: <code>1020:2009</code> or <code>1020:2009-04</code>, the latter indicating publication in April, 2009). <a href="#figure-example-document-number"></a> shows an example of the document numbering structure.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Director of Engineering shall assign document numbers (or root document numbers, in the case of multipart documents). Document numbers may be assigned at the request of the Technology Committee Chair(s) at any time after a Project is approved and shall be assigned before a Final Committee Draft ballot is issued.
      </p>
      <p>
        Older Engineering Documents may bear one-, two-, or three-digit document numbers or root document numbers. These numbers shall not be prepended with leading zeroes when formatted for printing, either in the document itself or in citations in other documents. Such document numbers shall be prepended with leading zeroes to fill them out to four digits, however, when used as part of an element’s filename; the purpose is to facilitate sorting into numerical order.

    <section id="sec-document-type">
      <h3>Engineering Document Type</h3>
      <p>
        The Type of Engineering Document (Standard, Recommended Practice or Engineering Guideline) shall be denoted by prepending a Type Designator, followed by a single space, to the document’s root number. The Type Designator shall be as follows:
      </p>

        <h4>General</h4>
        <p>
          Closely related Engineering Documents may be created as Parts. A Part of a document is a separate Engineering Document and shall be shown to be related to other  
          by using the same root document number plus a suffix of a hyphen and the Part number to distinguish among Parts (e.g. <code>1020-2:2009</code>, indicating document 1020, Part 2).

      <section id="sec-different-types">
        <h4>Parts of Different Types</h4>
        <p>
          A multipart set of documents may include Parts of different types of Engineering Documents, including Standards, Recommended Practices, and Engineering Guidelines. Each Part’s number shall include the appropriate document type designation (e.g. <code>RP 2046-2:2009</code>).
        </p>
      </section>

      <section id="sec-part-0-documents">
        <h4>Part 0 Documents</h4>
        <p>
          A multipart set of documents should be supplemented by an informative Part 0, informally described as an “Overview Document,” which shall describe the relationships among the Parts and may describe the relationships of the Parts to other Engineering Documents. Part 0 documents are not due process Engineering Documents;
        </p>
        <P>
          Part 0 documents usually should be prepared by the authors of the related engineering documents in cooperation with SMPTE headquarters staff and the responsible Technology Committee and Project Group. Part 0 documents shall be maintained by the Director of Engineering in consultation with the Technology Committee Chair(s) and the author(s) of the Part 0 document. If new Parts are added to a multipart set, or if any of the Parts of the set are revised, Part 0 shall be revised at the same time. The Part 0 designation shall not be used for any Engineering Document. Part 0 documents shall not bear a Type designator (i.e. it is not an ST, RP or EG).
        </p>
        <p>
          A Part 0 document should not contain forward-looking statements in regard to documents that are not ready for publication.
        </p>
        <p>
          As a general guideline, Part 0 documents should use the following structure:
        </p>
        <ol type="a">
          <li>
            an overview of the general application of the related engineering documents, in a language that can be understood by non-experts
          </li>
          <li>
            an overview of the scope of various related documents, with graphical representations, if appropriate
          </li>
          <li>
            an overview of the contextual relationships of various engineering documents
          </li>
        </ol>

      <section id="sec-normative-multipart">
        <h4>Normative References to Multipart Documents</h4>
        <p>
          Normative references to multipart documents always shall specify the individual Part or Parts being referenced and shall not reference the entire set by root number alone.

    <section id="sec-elements">
      <h3>Elements</h3>
      <p>
        Non-prose Elements of Engineering Documents (see <a href="#sec-formats-elements"></a>) shall be designated using a lower case
        letter (e.g. <code>1020a:2009</code> and <code>1020b:2009</code>). Media such as DVDs, as well as non-PDF formats, shall be clearly marked, as appropriate. The single prose element shall not receive aletter suffix.

    <section id="sec-number-space">
      <h3>Number Space</h3>
      <p>
        All new Engineering Documents shall share a common root number space, starting with 2000, except for new Parts of multipart documents that have a one-, two- or three-digit root.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the past, each type of Engineering Document had its own number space. This presented difficulties when a Technology Committee determined that the document type had to be changed (for example, changing a Recommended Practice to a Standard) if the number in the new number space already was in use. To address this going forward, the block of numbers from 1000 to 1999 has been allocated.
      </p>
      <p>
        If a Technology Committee determines that the classification of an Engineering Document with a one-, two- or three-digit root must be changed (e.g., from a Recommended Practice to a Standard) and there already is an Engineering Document with that number, the document whose classification is being changed shall have 1000 added to its root. For example, if the Technology Committee were to determine that Recommended Practice RP 222 should be changed to a Standard, its number would be changed to SMPTE ST 1222 because there already is a SMPTE ST 222.
      </p>
      <p>
        Each of the other published document types (i.e., Registered Disclosure Documents, Advisory Notes, Administrative Guidelines, and Engineering Reports) shall have its own number space independent of Engineering Documents and of each other. They otherwise shall follow the rules for document numbering specified in this Administrative Guideline.

      <h3>Document Packages Overview</h3>
      <p>
        Various document packages are needed during the development process. In all cases, a document being reviewed or voted upon shall be the current draft which is the “clean” version.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the event that any of the following is in conflict with the <a href="#bib-smpte-standards-operations-manual"></a>, the <a href="#bib-smpte-standards-operations-manual"></a> shall prevail.

      <h3>Working Draft Development</h3>
      <p>
        <a href="#sec-style-and-form"></a> of this AG has guidance for the use of templates for new projects, Revisions and Amendments.
      </p>
      <p>
        For Revisions the process of converting an old document into the current template changes section numbering and alters the appearance of the original document, even though the content of the document has not changed. In this case, it is recommended that the conversion to the current template should be made before any other changes are made. The document editor should “accept all changes” to create a clean starting point (the “baseline draft”) from which to track the technical and/or editorial revisions to the document.
      </p>
      <p>
        During Working Draft development (an informal process), a Project Group may provide intermediate draft documents and markups for review within the Project Group.  Intermediate document packages may include an informal Comment Resolution Record or a Comment Resolution Document.
      </p>
      <p>
        The state of these draft documents shall be “WD.” Project Groups should follow the recommendations and styles given in this Administrative Guideline for file names.
      </p>

      <h3>Pre-Ballot Review Document Package</h3>
      <p>
        The first step in the formal document process is the preparation of a Working Draft, which shall be marked as “WD.”  This document a package is provided by the Project Group to the Technology Committee Chair(s). This review is optional; See <a href="#bib-smpte-standards-operations-manual"></a> for guidance.
      </p>
      <p>
        The document package shall contain a clean draft. In addition it may contain one of the following:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          For new documents, no original work exists, so a markup is not meaningful.
        </li>
        <li>
          For a Revision, the Project Group should provide a markup from the published document (the baseline draft) in the template to be used for the revision project.
        </li>
        <li>
          For an Amendment, the formal document is the list of changes to be made to the published document. A markup from the published document may be provided at the Project Group’s discretion.
        </li>
        <li>
          If the document has one or more Element(s), the Element(s) or instructions for acquiring the Element(s) shall be included.
