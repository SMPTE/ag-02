      This Administrative Guideline defines the numbering format for
      SMPTE Engineering Documents and specifies the permitted file
      formats used during document development and publication. It
      also specifies other matters relating to SMPTE Engineering
      Documents with regard to language, style, format, document
      type, markups required at various stages of development, etc.
    </p>
    <p>
      Files that show the differences between two versions of the
      same document are called "markups" in this Administrative
      Guideline. "Markup" is intended to cover a variety of terms
      including: "redline," "tracked changes," "blackline," etc.

      <h3>Publication Formats Overview</h3>
      <p>
        SMPTE Engineering Documents may be published on paper or in various electronic formats and may comprise one or more separate elements. An Engineering Document always shall include a single prose element and may include other elements such as XML, spreadsheets, media files, and so forth. The collection of elements, regardless of formats employed, is the "Engineering Document" as a whole, and all elements shall be clearly identified in the prose element (see <a href="#sec-elements-ov"></a>). Any change to any element constitutes a change to the Engineering Document. The Project Group and the Technology Committee shall determine the number of elements for publication. The Director of Engineering shall determine the distribution media for all published documents. The format of publication shall alter neither the relevance of, nor the processes that otherwise are required for approval of, an Engineering Document.
      </p>
      <p>
        Engineering Document Elements may be packaged as one or more Elements using ZIP to facilitate the organization and distribution of the component files.

    <h2>Normative Language Forms</h2>
    <p>
      Normative information in a SMPTE Engineering Document may take the language form of prose, tables, figures, formal languages (e.g., mathematical formulae, BNF, XML, pseudo code), and other language forms. Mathematical formulae shall follow the definitions documented in <a href="#bib-iso-80000-2"></a> when possible. When <a href="#bib-iso-80000-2"></a> is not sufficient (e.g., BNF, XML Schema, etc.), a Normative Reference for the mathematical definitions used shall be provided.

    <h2>Document Numbering</h2>

    <section id="sec-document-numbering-overview">
      <h3>Document Numbering Overview</h3>
      <p>
        Document numbers shall be unique and uniform across all Engineering Document types. Versions of documents shall be identified by the year and month of their approval date, appended with a separating colon (e.g., for document #1020: <code>1020:2009-04</code> indicating approval in April, 2009). <a href="#figure-example-document-number"></a> shows an example of the document numbering structure. The approval date of a document indicates when it was last approved by its consensus body, e.g., Technical Committee. 
      </p>
      <p>
        The Director of Engineering shall assign document numbers (or root document numbers, in the case of multipart documents). Document numbers may be assigned at the request of the Technology Committee Chair(s) at any time after a Project is approved and shall be assigned before a Final Committee Draft ballot is issued.
      </p>
      <p>
        Older Engineering Documents may bear one-, two-, or three-digit document numbers or root document numbers. These numbers shall not be prepended with leading zeroes when formatted for printing, either in the document itself or in citations in other documents. Such document numbers shall be prepended with leading zeroes to fill them out to four digits, however, when used as part of an element’s filename; the purpose is to facilitate sorting into numerical order.

      <h3>Engineering Document Type</h3>
      <p>
        The Type of Engineering Document (Standard, Recommended Practice or Engineering Guideline) shall be denoted by prepending a Type Designator, followed by a single space, to the document’s root number. The Type Designator shall be as follows:
      </p>

      <dl>
        <dt>ST</dt><dd>Standard</dd>
        <dt>RP</dt><dd>Recommended Practice</dd>

        Although they are not Engineering Documents, Registered
        Disclosure Documents, Advisory Notes, Administrative
        Guidelines, and Engineering Reports shall bear Type
        Designators as follows:
      </p>

      <dl>
        <dt>RDD</dt><dd>Registered Disclosure Document</dd>
        <dt>AN</dt><dd>Advisory Note</dd>

        <h4>General</h4>
        <p>
          Closely related Engineering Documents may be created as Parts. A Part of a document is a separate Engineering Document and shall be shown to be related to other  
          by using the same root document number plus a suffix of a hyphen and the Part number to distinguish among Parts (e.g. <code>1020-2:2009-04</code>, indicating document 1020, Part 2).

      <section id="sec-different-types">
        <h4>Parts of Different Types</h4>
        <p>
          A multipart set of documents may include Parts of different types of Engineering Documents, including Standards, Recommended Practices, and Engineering Guidelines. Each Part’s number shall include the appropriate document type designation (e.g. <code>RP 2046-2:2009-04</code>).
        </p>
      </section>

      <section id="sec-part-0-documents">
        <h4>Part 0 Documents</h4>
        <p>
          A multipart set of documents should be supplemented by an informative Part 0, informally described as an “Overview Document,” which shall describe the relationships among the Parts and may describe the relationships of the Parts to other Engineering Documents. Part 0 documents are not due process Engineering Documents;
        </p>
        <P>
          Part 0 documents usually should be prepared by the authors of the related engineering documents in cooperation with SMPTE headquarters staff and the responsible Technology Committee and Project Group. Part 0 documents shall be maintained by the Director of Engineering in consultation with the Technology Committee Chair(s) and the author(s) of the Part 0 document. If new Parts are added to a multipart set, or if any of the Parts of the set are revised, Part 0 shall be revised at the same time. The Part 0 designation shall not be used for any Engineering Document. Part 0 documents shall not bear a Type designator (i.e. it is not an ST, RP or EG).
        </p>
        <p>
          A Part 0 document should not contain forward-looking statements in regard to documents that are not ready for publication.
        </p>
        <p>
          As a general guideline, Part 0 documents should use the following structure:
        </p>
        <ol type="a">
          <li>
            an overview of the general application of the related engineering documents, in a language that can be understood by non-experts
          </li>
          <li>
            an overview of the scope of various related documents, with graphical representations, if appropriate
          </li>
          <li>
            an overview of the contextual relationships of various engineering documents
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          Examples of Part 0 documents: SMPTE 2052-0 or SMPTE 425-0.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section id="sec-normative-multipart">
        <h4>Normative References to Multipart Documents</h4>
        <p>
          Normative references to multipart documents always shall specify the individual Part or Parts being referenced and shall not reference the entire set by root number alone.
        </p>
      </section>
    </section>
    
    <section id="sec-elements-ov">
      <h3>Elements</h3>
      <p>
        Non-prose Elements of Engineering Documents (see <a href="#sec-formats-elements"></a>) shall be designated using a lower case
        letter (e.g. <code>1020a:2009-04</code> and <code>1020b:2009-04</code>). Media such as DVDs, as well as non-PDF formats, shall be clearly marked, as appropriate. The single prose element shall not receive aletter suffix.

    </section>

    <section id="sec-number-space">
      <h3>Number Space</h3>
      <p>
        All new Engineering Documents shall share a common root number space, starting with 2000, except for new Parts of multipart documents that have a one-, two- or three-digit root.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the past, each type of Engineering Document had its own number space. This presented difficulties when a Technology Committee determined that the document type had to be changed (for example, changing a Recommended Practice to a Standard) if the number in the new number space already was in use. To address this going forward, the block of numbers from 1000 to 1999 has been allocated.
      </p>
      <p>
        If a Technology Committee determines that the classification of an Engineering Document with a one-, two- or three-digit root must be changed (e.g., from a Recommended Practice to a Standard) and there already is an Engineering Document with that number, the document whose classification is being changed shall have 1000 added to its root. For example, if the Technology Committee were to determine that Recommended Practice RP 222 should be changed to a Standard, its number would be changed to SMPTE ST 1222 because there already is a SMPTE ST 222.
      </p>
      <p>
        Each of the other published document types (i.e., Registered Disclosure Documents, Advisory Notes, Administrative Guidelines, and Engineering Reports) shall have its own number space independent of Engineering Documents and of each other. They otherwise shall follow the rules for document numbering specified in this Administrative Guideline.

      </p>
      <p>
        For Revisions the process of converting an old document into the current template changes section numbering and alters the appearance of the original document, even though the content of the document has not changed. In this case, it is recommended that the conversion to the current template should be made before any other changes are made. The document editor should “accept all changes” to create a clean starting point (the “baseline draft”) from which to track the technical and/or editorial revisions to the document.

      <h3>Pre-Ballot Review Document Package</h3>
      <p>
        The first step in the formal document process is the preparation of a Working Draft, which shall be marked as “WD.”  This document a package is provided by the Project Group to the Technology Committee Chair(s). This review is optional; See <a href="#bib-smpte-standards-operations-manual"></a> for guidance.

        The document package shall contain a clean draft. In addition it may contain one of the following:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          For new documents, no original work exists, so a markup is not meaningful.
        </li>
        <li>
          For a Revision, the Project Group should provide a markup from the published document (the baseline draft) in the template to be used for the revision project.
        </li>
        <li>
          For an Amendment, the formal document is the list of changes to be made to the published document. A markup from the published document may be provided at the Project Group’s discretion.
