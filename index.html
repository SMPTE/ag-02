      <h2>Scope</h2>
      <p>
        This Administrative Guideline defines the numbering format for
        SMPTE Engineering Documents and specifies the permitted file
        formats used during document development and publication. It
        also specifies other matters relating to SMPTE Engineering
        Documents with regard to language, style, format, document
        type, markups required at various stages of development, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
        Files that show the differences between two versions of the
        same document are called "markups" in this Administrative
        Guideline. "Markup" is intended to cover a variety of terms
        including: "redline," "tracked changes," "blackline," etc.

        All SMPTE Engineering documents shall be written in
        U. S. English. Translations into other languages by SMPTE (or
        by 3rd parties authorized by SMPTE) are encouraged but not
        required. In the event of discrepancy, the original English
        language document shall be authoritative.

          All Engineering Documents should follow the guidelines of
          the International Organization for Standardization (ISO)
          Directives with the following exceptions: In the event of a
          conflict, explicit provisions of SMPTE Operations Manuals
          and Administrative Guidelines shall prevail. Any variances
          from the ISO Directives shall be approved by the Director of
          Engineering or the Standards Vice President.
        </p>
        <p>
          Particular attention should be given to the following

        <h3>SMPTE Templates</h3>
        <p>
          All new Engineering Documents shall use the appropriate,
          approved SMPTE template. (See Administrative Guideline
          <a href="https://smpte.github.io/ag-04/">AG-04</a>
          Engineering Document Templates.) This will ensure proper
          revision management through and including final
          publication. Document templates can be found in the Standards
          Community document repository.

      <section id="sec-revisions-and-amendments">
        <h3>Revisions and Amendments</h3>
        <p>
          A revision of an Engineering Document may use the original
          template if the resulting prose is identical to that
          resulting from use of the current template and the Standards
          Vice President or Director of Engineering agree to the use
          of the original publication template.
        </p>
        <p>
          For a revision of an Engineering Document, the Project Group
          should start with the Publication Master, which usually can
          be obtained from SMPTE HQ. The Project Group may, at its
          discretion, recreate the original document, as published, if
          an editable master cannot be found. The Project Group is
          encouraged to follow the ISO Directives but is under no
          obligation to do so.
        </p>
        <p>
          An Amendment shall use the current template.

      <h2>Publication Formats and Elements</h2>

      <section id="sec-publication-formats-overview">
        <h3>Publication Formats Overview</h3>
        <p>
          SMPTE Engineering Documents may be published on paper or in
          various electronic formats and may comprise one or more
          separate elements. An Engineering Document always shall
          include a single prose element and may include other
          elements such as XML, spreadsheets, media files, and so
          forth. The collection of elements, regardless of formats
          employed, is the "Engineering Document" as a whole, and all
          elements shall be clearly identified in the prose element
          (see <a href="#sec-elements">""</a>). Any change to any
          element constitutes a change to the Engineering
          Document. The Project Group and the Technology Committee
          shall determine the number of elements for publication. The
          Director of Engineering shall determine the distribution
          media for all published documents. The format of publication
          shall alter neither the relevance of, nor the processes that
          otherwise are required for approval of, an Engineering
          Document.
        </p>
        <p>
          En Document Elements may be packaged as one or more Elements
          using ZIP to facilitate the organization and distribution of
          the component files.

        <h3>File Formats for Document Submission</h3>
        <p>
          Engineering Documents and other contributed documents shall
          be submitted to a Technology Committee or its subgroups in a
          limited set of file formats. The following formats are
          approved:
          <dl>
            <dt><b>Prose and Embedded Tables:</b> .doc and .docx</dt>
            <dd>

                Engineering Documents should use Office 2007 formats
                (.docx) for Prose and tabular documents. Engineering
                Documents may use Office 2003 formats (.doc) as
                needed. The Project Group shall determine which format
                to use on a project- by-project basis. Conversions
                between Office 2003 and Office 2007 formats are not
                perfect. To minimize the risk of unintended artifacts,
                conversion between formats is not required.

      <h2>Normative Language Forms</h2>
      <p>
        Normative information in a SMPTE Engineering Document may take
        the language form of prose, tables, figures, formal languages
        (e.g., mathematical formulae, BNF, XML, pseudo code), and
        other language forms. Mathematical formulae shall follow the
        definitions documented in ISO 80000-2 when possible. When ISO
        80000-2 is not sufficient (e.g., BNF, XML Schema, etc.), a
        Normative Reference for the mathematical definitions used
        shall be provided. Such Normative Reference shall comply with
        the provisions of the SMPTE Standards Operations Manual and
        AG-03 Normative References.

      <p>
        When language forms other than prose are present, the prose
        shall state whether the language is normative or
        informative. Normative provisions shall be enabled explicitly
        (e.g., "The dimensions of figure 1 shall be used."). The
        presence of non-prose information without prose conformance
        language shall be deemed informative.

        <h3>Document Numbering Overview</h3>
        <p>
          Document numbers shall be unique and uniform across all
          Engineering Document types. Versions of documents shall be
          identified by their year of publication and, optionally,
          their month of publication, appended with a separating colon
          (e.g., for document #1020: 1020:2009 or 1020:2009-04, the

          The Director of Engineering shall assign document numbers
          (or root document numbers, in the case of multipart
          documents). Document numbers may be assigned at the request
          of the Technology Committee Chair(s) at any time after a
          Project is approved and shall be assigned before a Final
          Committee Draft ballot is issued.
        </p>
        <p>
          Older Engineering Documents may bear one-, two-, or
          three-digit document numbers or root document numbers. These
          numbers shall not be prepended with leading zeroes when
          formatted for printing, either in the document itself or in
          citations in other documents. Such document numbers shall be
          prepended with leading zeroes to fill them out to four
          digits, however, when used as part of an element’s filename;
          the purpose is to facilitate sorting into numerical order.

            multipart set, or if any of the Parts of the set are
            revised, Part 0 shall be revised at the same time. The
            Part 0 designation shall not be used for any Engineering

        <h3>Number Space</h3>
        <p>
          All new Engineering Documents shall share a common root
          number space, starting with 2000, except for new Parts of
          multipart documents that have a one-, two- or three-digit
          root.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the past, each type of Engineering Document had its own
          number space. This presented difficulties when a Technology
          Committee determined that the document type had to be
          changed (for example, changing a Recommended Practice to a
          Standard) if the number in the new number space already was
          in use. To address this going forward, the block of numbers
          from 1000 to 1999 has been allocated.
        </p>
        <p>
          If a Technology Committee determines that the classification
          of an Engineering Document with a one-, two- or three-digit
          root must be changed (e.g., from a Recommended Practice to a
          Standard) and there already is an Engineering Document with
          that number, the document whose classification is being
          changed shall have 1000 added to its root. For example, if
          the Technology Committee were to determine that Recommended
          Practice RP 222 should be changed to a Standard, its number
          would be changed to SMPTE ST 1222 because there already is a
          SMPTE ST 222.
        </p>
        <p>
          Each of the other published document types (i.e., Registered
          Disclosure Documents, Advisory Notes, Administrative
          Guidelines, and Engineering Reports) shall have its own
          number space independent of Engineering Documents and of
          each other. They otherwise shall follow the rules for
          document numbering specified in this Administrative
          Guideline.

          Section <a href="#sec-style-and-form">""</a> of this AG has
          guidance for the use of templates for new projects,
          Revisions and Amendments.
        </p>
        <p>
          For Revisions the process of converting an old document into
          the current template changes section numbering and alters
          the appearance of the original document, even though the
          content of the document has not changed. In this case, it is
          recommended that the conversion to the current template
          should be made before any other changes are made. The
          document editor should “accept all changes” to create a
          clean starting point (the “baseline draft”) from which to
          track the technical and/or editorial revisions to the
          document.
        </p>
        <p>
          During Working Draft development (an informal process), a
          Project Group may provide intermediate draft documents and
          markups for review within the Project Group.  Intermediate
          document packages may include an informal Comment Resolution
          Record or a Comment Resolution Document.
        </p>
        <p>
          The state of these draft documents shall be “WD.” Project
          Groups should follow the recommendations and styles given in
          this Administrative Guideline for file names.
